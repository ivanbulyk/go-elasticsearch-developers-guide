You need a fairly large set of data to load into Elasticsearch. This web site STAPI, a Star Trek API contains huge amounts of data from the Star Trek universe. You will use the spacecraft data as our dataset for this application. It is always a good idea to know what the data looks like. Enter the URL http://stapi.co/api/v1/rest/spacecraft/search?pageNumber=0&pageSize=100&pretty into a web browser. You should see a JSON object containing page information and a list of spacecraft information. There are over 1200 spacecraft in total.
